# Yr13Website - README
This website was the first version of 'Pakiri Clay' website and was used for the final digital technology assignment in college. While there are a few minor errors and you not being able to upload images to the webpage, 
it is pretty much fully functional with a fully working store page, cart, administrator page, home page, and contact page. <br>
This website was created using localhost. <br>
The login for the admin account is **'Email: admin'** and **'Password: 12345'**.
